CYBER FOREST CTF CHAPTER 03
# ðŸŒ² CYBER FOREST: The Nexus

An immersive, visual CTF challenge where players must navigate a massive network "forest" of 1000+ cables to find flags.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Concept

You are a hacker probing a vast corporate network. The only map is the network itself. Use real tools like nmap, ftp, and traceroute (simulated in-browser) to explore nodes, find vulnerabilities, and recover secrets hidden in the cyber forest.
